                Though our laboratory is humble compared to the extravagant displays seen in other "legitimate" places of science, we are still more than capable
                in the development of a wide variety of tools to help in our noble cause.

                    Prior to my being thrust into this dimension, I studied engineering at Tokyo Denki University.  Though during my time my assistant, I gained an interest
                    in nueroscience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for the time being, I am continuing along a slightly different path. My dimensional counterpart also seemed to be an engineer. In fact, I would
                    expect nothing else from any version of myself! As such, I am pursuing skills in programming and development. This biography site is part of this.

                    What a convenient project! I can make this site to practice the skills I need to survive in this strange world and it gives another layer of protection
                    from those that might be trying to track me down. Who would believe that an interdimensional mad scientist would choose to reveal himself in the form
                    of a simple college web development assignment?

                    Though the size of our operation gives us a layer of protection from our potential enemies, we must remain ever vigilant that we are not taken
                    by surprise from potential conspirators. As such, I am ever vigilant in keeping an eye on the areas that my allies and I frequent.
