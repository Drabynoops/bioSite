                <p>The universe may not have a discernable end, it's infinite</p>
                <p>but it had a beginning</p>
                <p>And as for it's component parts, the stars, they definitely have a limited cosmological shelf life, they're finite</p>
                <p>If history tells us anything it's that scientists often make very poor poets</p>
                <p>We're a ship of fools, chasing phantoms. Heedless of what underwrites natural law</p>
                <p>If we could somehow attain that wisdom, perhaps it would only plunge us into madness and ruin</p>
                <p>Humans exceeding the speed of light?</p>
                <p>It's more foolish than fish attempting to make a life on land</p>
                <p>And yet?</p>
                <p>These words...</p>
                <p>They are meant for those foolhardy enough to defy the counsels of fate</p>
