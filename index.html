                <p>The universe may not have a discernable end, it's infinite</p>
                <p>but it had a beginning</p>
                <p>And as for it's component parts, the stars, they definitely have a limited cosmological shelf life, they're finite</p>
                <p>If history tells us anything it's that scientists often make very poor poets</p>
                <p>We're a ship of fools, chasing phantoms. Heedless of what underwrites natural law</p>
                <p>If we could somehow attain that wisdom, perhaps it would only plunge us into madness and ruin</p>
                <p>Humans exceeding the speed of light?</p>
                <p>It's more foolish than fish attempting to make a life on land</p>
                <p>And yet?</p>
                <p>These words...</p>
                <p>They are meant for those foolhardy enough to defy the counsels of fate</p>
                <p>An epigraph for their obstinance</p>

            <div class="card-title">Aren't you an anime character?</div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>Ah! So you have heard of my exploits before then, have you?</p>
                <p>It is true, there is a plethora of media about myself and my exploits across many a worldline.</p>
                <p>Experimentation with the Time Leap Machine led to an unexpected result, I found myself ejected from my own reality and landing in this one.
                I know not of the life my dimensional counterpart lead before I found myself inhabiting his mind, but I know that I must do my best to live the rest of
                his life to the fullest to honor his loss.</p>

                <p>I plan to do so by gathering any allies I can to save this world from it's very own version of the organization.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-title">Why are you advertising yourself?</div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>I have already explained by desires to in the last snippet, but I will reward your curiosity by divulging you a larger picture of my plans.</p>
                <p>
                    Based on my research, the time leap machine sends a version of myself while leaving the me that used it intact. Presumably, my comrades have no idea
                    that they sent a version of me into another dimension and will not follow. However, if there is a Crono to my Marle, advertising myself poses little risk.
                    Those who know of me in this world will think nothing of this "fun little project", but those from my own world will attempt to track me down to
                    rejoin forces.
                </p>
                <p>Of course, any new allies that I gain along the way will be warmly welcome!</p>

            <div class="card-title">Okay? Why aren't you trying to return to your own dimension?</div>

                    I long to see my compatriots again, yes, but another crop reaped from the seed that was my research was that I ultimately succeed in
                    protecting my friends and ending the threats of both SERN and World War III. My world is safe and now I set to release another one 
                    from a false control set by those who put themselves in power from unscrupulous means.
